# ChardhamAPIs

ChardhamAPIs is a comprehensive API project designed to facilitate the Char Dham Yatra pilgrimage in India. This project encompasses a range of APIs that serve various purposes, including providing directions for the Char Dham Yatra, managing restaurant information, temple creation, feedback submission, and a help module for users.

The primary aim of ChardhamAPIs is to simplify the planning and navigation process for individuals embarking on the revered Char Dham Yatra pilgrimage, which covers four holy sites in Uttarakhand: Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath. The direction API offers detailed route information, helping pilgrims navigate the journey with ease and ensuring a smooth travel experience.

Furthermore, ChardhamAPIs includes APIs for restaurant creation and management. This feature enables the provision of information about local eateries along the pilgrimage route, allowing users to explore and choose from a variety of dining options.

Additionally, the project incorporates APIs for temple creation, offering insights into the different temples situated in the Char Dham circuit. Users can access details such as temple locations, opening hours, and historical significance, enriching their spiritual experience.

The feedback API allows users to share their opinions and experiences with regards to the pilgrimage, temples, and restaurants visited during their journey. This feedback module enables continuous improvement and helps other users make informed decisions.

Lastly, ChardhamAPIs includes a help module that provides assistance and support to users throughout their Char Dham Yatra. This feature comprises a collection of APIs that offer guidance, information, and answers to frequently asked questions, ensuring a seamless and fulfilling pilgrimage experience.
